# Assignment 2 Postmortem

## What's your name?

Katie Hegarty

## How difficult was this assignment?

This assignment was much more difficult than previous assignments, however the office hours were very helpful. 


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
I leaned a ton of new things from this assignment, like including images and fonts and using bootstrap in general. 


## How could this assignment be improved?
I think the grid system could have been explained a little more fully, and the wireframe could have been explained a little more. Those were two issues that tripped me up during the assignment but should have been pretty straightforward. 


## Any other comments?
The class is moving at a pretty reasonable pace, and I feel like I have adequate time to finish all the assignments.
